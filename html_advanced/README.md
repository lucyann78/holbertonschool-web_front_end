By the end of this project, you’ll be able to confidently build and structure HTML web pages. You’ll learn how to create an HTML5 page skeleton, use semantic tags like <header>, <main>, <footer>, and <article>, and understand when to use <div> vs <span>. You’ll also master headings, lists, tables, and how to embed images, videos, audio, and external content. These skills will help you create clean, organized, and accessible web pages.
