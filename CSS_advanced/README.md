By the end of this project, you will be able to confidently explain key CSS concepts, including selectors, properties, and values; the differences between block and inline styling; and how to ensure consistency across browsers with CSS resets. You will also learn to set up CSS variables, distinguish between inline, embedded, and external CSS, and understand grid systems using floats. Additionally, you'll grasp the differences between icon webfonts and SVG icons, the roles of pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements, techniques for creating background gradients, animating elements, transforming 2D and 3D elements, and the purpose of vendor prefixes.
